These features can be created using techniques like bag-of-words, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), or word embeddings. Text features are essential for natural language processing (NLP) tasks and can provide valuable insights into the context and sentiment of the text.

#### 2.2.5 Image Features

Image features are derived from image data and can include characteristics like edges, textures, colors, and shapes. Techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used to extract features from images. Image features are crucial in tasks like image classification, object detection, and computer vision.

### 2.3 Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a critical step in the feature engineering process, ensuring that the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis. This step involves several techniques, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and data transformation.

#### 2.3.1 Data Cleaning

Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the dataset. This can include removing duplicate records, correcting typos, and standardizing formats. Data cleaning is essential to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, as errors can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models.

#### 2.3.2 Handling Missing Values

Handling missing values is a crucial aspect of data preprocessing. Missing data can occur due to various reasons, such as data entry errors or incomplete records. There are several strategies to handle missing values, including:

- **Removal**: Deleting records with missing values if the proportion is small and won't significantly impact the analysis.
- **Imputation**: Replacing missing values with statistical estimates like mean, median, or mode.
- **Prediction**: Using machine learning models to predict and fill in missing values based on other features.

Choosing the appropriate strategy depends on the nature of the data and the problem at hand.

#### 2.3.3 Data Transformation

Data transformation involves converting data into a suitable format for analysis. This can include scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data. Common data transformation techniques include:

- **Scaling**: Adjusting the range of numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale. Techniques include standardization (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) and normalization (scaling to a range of 0 to 1).
- **Encoding**: Converting categorical features into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, and frequency encoding.
- **Normalization**: Adjusting the data distribution to improve model performance, especially for algorithms sensitive to data scale.

Effective data transformation ensures that the features are in an optimal format for machine learning models, enhancing their performance and accuracy.
